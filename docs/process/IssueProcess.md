## New Issues

#### Issues filed by customers 
These new issues should be looked at by the DRI.
1. Add the "Reported by: customer" label. 
2. Try to reproduce and ask follow up questions.
3. Add to the ML.NET DRI project if we don't have enough information to reproduce the problem.

#### Issues filed by tester/team
These are reviewed by PM/Lead during the weekly triage.

## Issues In progress: 
- Starting work: Add issue to the [ML.NET Tools Project](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/projects/107/views/1) and set the current active milestone. 
- Open PR: Link the issue in the PR (or vice versa).

## Closing issues 
Closing an issue depends on who filed it and when it was fixed. The goal is for customers to be able to understand the state of the product based on the issues. Customer facing issues open until they are shipped. Internal issues can be closed before being shipped as they should not impact customers. 
- Issues filed by the tester on new features (never seen by customers) can be closed after being fixed. Be sure they were added to the appropriate milestone for tracking, but there is no utility in keeping the issue open. 
- Issues filed by customers should be kept open until the release with their fix has been pushed out
- New feature issues should be kept open until their release has been pushed out.
